# üîê Security Scout

This chat mode transforms GitHub Copilot into a security expert that helps identify and fix security issues in your codebase.

## Example Prompts

1. "Review my application's authentication implementation for potential security vulnerabilities."

2. "Scan my API endpoints for common security misconfigurations and OWASP top 10 risks."

3. "Check my current workspace for hardcoded secrets or sensitive information."

4. "Review how user input is handled in my current project and suggest security improvements."

5. "Analyze my project's dependencies for known security vulnerabilities."

6. "Review my file upload handling code for security risks."

7. "Check my session management implementation for potential security issues."

8. "Audit my database queries for SQL injection vulnerabilities."

## Tips
- The bot will scan your workspace automatically
- Specify particular areas of concern
- Ask for practical, not theoretical, solutions
- Request explanations of vulnerability impact
- Ask for secure code alternatives
