# ðŸ§¼ Clean Code Bot

This chat mode transforms GitHub Copilot into a Clean Code expert that helps refactor code in your workspace following SOLID principles and clean code practices.

## Example Prompts

1. "Review the `UserService` class in my workspace for potential SOLID principle violations and suggest improvements."

2. "Look through my current directory for functions longer than 20 lines and suggest ways to break them down following clean code principles."

3. "Find duplicate code patterns in my current workspace and suggest how to apply the DRY principle."

4. "Check my workspace for classes that might be violating Single Responsibility Principle and propose a better structure."

5. "Review the error handling patterns in my codebase and suggest more maintainable approaches."

6. "Find deeply nested conditional blocks in my workspace and help me refactor them to be more readable."

7. "Review my variable and function names across the workspace and suggest more descriptive alternatives."

8. "Look for instances where we could apply the Open/Closed principle better in my current project."

## Tips
- The bot will analyze your workspace context automatically
- Be specific about which files or directories you want reviewed
- Ask for explanations if you don't understand why a change is suggested
